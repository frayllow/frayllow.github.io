                    <h2>PANIC ACTIVATE!</h2>
                    <p>University apps usually start in September of every year and are 
                        truer for the Big 4 universities: University of the Philippines, 
                        Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University. Since my 
                        batch was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic we didn’t have 
                        entrance exams but you (the lower batches) might have to. </p>
                    <p>What I can tell you to not suffer with acads na nadagdagan pa ng 
                        college apps is to prepare early on (paulit ulit na to I know). The applications usually ask
                        about your grades so it would be good to request your Transcript
                        of Record (Form 137) ahead of time, also some would ask for
                        certificates for your extra-curricular activities. If you are
                        like me that didn’t have a lot of credentials, oh no time to
                        cram. For me, the youth orgs I joined in the prior summer
                        saved me. As for other options in getting credentials, you
                        could also try internships.</p>
                    <p>There are also application fees excluding UP and a few others
                        unless your school has privileges.</p>
                    <p>If there is one thing that I regretted the most during my college
                        app season, is relying too much on emails. Not all unis send emails on your application updates, you’d have to go and check the portal regularly, but still, check your email almost every day. Ngl you might develop FOMO, well at least I did.

                    <h2>Abang abang all the time</h2>
                    <p>There are multiple scholarships out there aside from the 
                        DOST-SEI scholarship most of us know about. The problem however
                        is unlike university applications that come out on your social
                        media feed, you have to make an effort on where you can find
                        open scholarship apps. In fact, I am still hunting until a few
                        weeks after my high school graduation. Good thing though there
                        are a lot of social media groups that share available scholarships
                        and it would really benefit you to add these to your favorites
                        so that you get notified of everything new.</p>
                    <p>A word of advice though, these scholarship applications ask a lot
                        about family finances so make sure you have your parents dedicate
                        some time with you to fill these out. I know some families can be
                        toxic and would go about “Ba’t di mo pa ‘yan alam?” and it’s probably
                        something some of you would have to endure but you really have to annoy
                        them no matter what or you won’t finish it. It would also be good for
                        you to ask for your parents’ Annual Income Tax Return ahead of time and
                        compile the recent 3 months of water and electricity bills.</p>
                    <p>For international scholarships, there are also a lot you can find
                        through social media. They are usually specified in which countries
                        they are offered. Though I’m not really the right person to ask this. </p>
                    <p>And lastly a heads up, most scholarships especially those from private
                        entities (is this even the right word basta companies, foundations, 
                        and all) are only for top students or financially struggling.</p>

                    <h2>I was on the brink of selling my soul</h2>
                    <p>SAT, short for Scholastic Assessment Test. It is a 
                        standardized test that you can use to apply for international 
                        universities. You can register for it on collegeboard.org which
                        also offers study materials and practice tests in their KhanAcademy
                        collab. There is plenty of free study material online and KhanAcademy
                        SAT is the one I would recommend the most, however, the test itself
                        is pretty expensive which would cost you more than $100, and aside
                        from that test centers are pretty limited so you might have to travel
                        someplace else for the test. So now with these expenses, my first advice
                        is DON’T THROW THE TEST.</p>
                    <p>If you plan on studying internationally, this is a test you can take
                        or the ACT but I don’t know much about that one. It is really vital
                        that if you plan to take, take it as soon as possible, preferably
                        before school starts so that you can dedicate fully to preparing
                        for it because I swear it will be hard to juggle between acads
                        and studying for the SAT. The seats are also limited and would
                        usually be full 2 months prior (like back in the December 2021 SAT).</p>
                    <p>As for studying for the test, I will not stop emphasizing making use of
                        the KhanAcademy SAT. The practice tests there are also made to be
                        similar to the actual ones. It would also benefit you to employ
                        effective study techniques such as spaced repetition and active
                        recall. Another is to focus more on the mastery of your strengths,
                        getting the easy questions correct will benefit you more than struggling
                        to find the answer to the harder questions because all of them are worth one
                        point - even the questions with no choices in the Math sections. </p>
                    <p>I also would
                        advise you not to grind and study 8 hours every day or you will burn yourself
                        out before the exam (just like I did huhu) unless you’re a monster. Allot
                        at least 50 days before the d-day to study.  Lastly, there is also a lot of
                        other reliable SAT prep material such as Barron’s or Erica Meltzer’s, the latter
                        I highly recommend for reading comprehension (the hardest to perfect). Oh, and take
                        the SAT essay especially if you are aiming for the top universities.</p>
                    <p>INSERT: You have 4 FREE universities to send your scores within 9 days that
                         you receive them. You can also choose which unis before you even get
                          to receive them. Don’t make the same mistake I did.</p>

                    <h2>The Common App is your bestie</h2>
                    <p>Common App is basically a site where a lot of universities have
                        their online application procedures like Edukasyon.ph. Most
                        universities from the United States and Europe are available
                        through Common App (for Asia, you’d have to search up the
                        portals yourself, sadly). I suggest you make an account early
                        on and choose target schools, even ones that you only want to
                        join in your dreams so that you can receive emails in case they
                        offer application fee waivers or scholarships. You can then ask
                        your school registrar to upload your Transcript of Records or Form
                        138 in Common App (they know what to do).</p>
                    <p>For international universities, it is really recommended that you
                        apply for Early Decision because a lot say that you would have
                        higher success rates. This is usually around in October or November
                        so it would do you well to take the ACT or SAT (if required) earlier
                        than that.</p>
                    <p>Again I didn’t really apply for International unis, I just took the 
                        SAT for clout (but don’t be like me, make most of everything).</p>

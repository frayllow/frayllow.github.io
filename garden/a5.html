                    <p>In the last days of June, I told you about being scared
                        because I might not be able to equal your love for me.
                        I didn’t want to disappoint you, but telling you to end
                        what’s going on between us hurt me more than I expected.
                        Joan even dubbed you as my TOTGA when I had to come to her
                        for comfort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be honest, when I started talking again to you, I still 
                        somewhat felt that the cruel words I said to you were true, 
                        but this time I had gambled my feelings and also yours. This
                        would have either end in a happy relationship or a painful 
                        disaster. I’m so sorry for taking such a huge risk, but now
                        I have no regrets.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        There are no more doubts on what I feel for you, nor do I 
                        think they are any lesser than yours.
                    </p>
